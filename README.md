This is an example of using convertible extensions in Expo Sweet API + shared objects to create an exhausting binding to part of Apple `CoreHaptics`. This enables you to play with a number of haptic configurations using Fast Refresh and OTA. The majority of the native module was generated with copilot, and the entire TypeScript interface was AI generated.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with a JS-driven approach to native modules which is more backwards compatible as it aligns with the underlying native APIs. The drawback is that it's more verbose, not cross-platform, and requires a lot of binding codeâ€”which is mitigated by the use of AI and predictable binding patterns.
